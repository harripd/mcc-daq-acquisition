# General setup (Counters/Channels) and Acquisition

# Changing number of channels is not really supported.
# Maybe 1 channel works, but 3 were definitely never tested.
channels: 2

# Use channel 0 and 1 on the counter if possible.
# Used channels have to form a continuous sequence [start_ctr,..,end_ctr].
start_ctr: 0
end_ctr: 1

# These are the settings you may want to modify:
acquisition_rate: 2e5 # maximum 2e6 for current counter module, 2e5 for Windows however.
buffer_size: 4e6 # Buffer size for each channel. 2*acquisition_rate is reasonable.

# Visualization settings
canvas_width: 1000
canvas_height: 800
bin_size: 10e3 #in 1/s. Only used for visualization! see acquisition_rate instead.
